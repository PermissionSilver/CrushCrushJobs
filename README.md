# Crush Crush Job Optimisation Tool
This is a tool to help find the optimal time block allocation to earn as much money as possible in crush crush. I have made the source code available in the file Jobs.java so that people can ensure the program isn't malicious in any way and can use it as a base for their own programs.

# Running the Tool
1. Download the file Jobs.jar
2. If asked to keep or discard the file, choose keep (many browsers treat jar files as malware)
3. Double click the file and wait a few seconds for the window to be displayed

# Using the Tool
1. Select which levels of each job you have available from the drop-down menus
2. Click the button next to each job to indicate that it's gilded
3. Enter the maximum amount of time blocks you're willing to allocate to jobs
4. (Optional) Enter your gem boost and reset boost to accurately display how much you can earn
5. The jobs you should select for maximum income will be displayed on the right of the screen

# Disclaimers
1. This tool was designed to work with mac on a relatively small screen so may not look as good on other setups
2. For some reason the text "Fast Food" blurs and I don't know why. This didn't seem to cause any major problems so I left it as is
3. The application can freeze briefly when you change a setting as it updates the jobs, however this wasn't too bad on a 5yo machine so hopefully it's not an issue
4. It may not always find the optimal selection as it does technically use rng, although there should be a large enough sample size to mitigate this
5. The tool will not take into account jobs levelling up as this would require far more user input and computation than is already required
6. I wrote the entire program overnight, finishing at 6am, so please excuse any issues and questionable programming
